Holdout validation is actually a specific example of a larger class of validation techniques called k-fold cross-validation. While holdout validation is better than train/test validation because the model isn't repeatedly biased towards a specific subset of the data, both models that are trained only use half the available data. K-fold cross validation, on the other hand, takes advantage of a larger proportion of the data during training while still rotating through different subsets of the data to avoid the issues of train/test validation.\n",

    "While the average RMSE value was approximately 135, the RMSE values ranged from 102 to 159+. This large amount of variability between the RMSE values means that we're either using a poor model or a poor evaluation criteria (or a bit of both!). By implementing your own k-fold cross-validation function, you hopefully acquired a good understanding of the inner workings of the technique. The function we wrote, however, has many limitations. If we want to now change the number of folds we want to use, we need to make the function more general so it can also handle randomizing the ordering of the rows in the dataframe and splitting into folds.\n",

    "In machine learning, we're interested in building a good model and accurately understanding how well it will perform. To build a better k-nearest neighbors model, we can change the features it uses or tweak the number of neighbors (a hyperparameter). To accurately understand a model's performance, we can perform k-fold cross validation and select the proper number of folds. We've learned how scikit-learn makes it easy for us to quickly experiment with these different knobs when it comes to building a better model. Let's now dive into how we can use scikit-learn to handle cross-validation as well.\n",

For example, assuming that only one feature, like a car's weight, relates to a car's fuel efficiency will lead you to fit a simple, univariate regression model that will result in high bias. The error rate will be high since a car's fuel efficiency is affected by many other factors besides just its weight.\n",

If we were given a dataset with 1000 features on each car and used every single feature to train an incredibly complicated multivariate regression model, we will have low bias but high variance. In an ideal world, we want low bias and low variance but in reality, there's always a tradeoff.\n",
