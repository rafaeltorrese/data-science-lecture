    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier lesson, we learned about train/test validation, a simple technique for testing a machine learning model's accuracy on new data that the model wasn't trained on. In this lesson, we'll focus on more robust techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we'll focus on the **holdout validation** technique, which involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- splitting the full dataset into 2 partitions:\n",
    "    - a training set\n",
    "    - a test set\n",
    "- training the model on the training set,\n",
    "- using the trained model to predict labels on the test set,\n",
    "- computing an error metric to understand the model's effectiveness,\n",
    "- switch the training and test sets and repeat,\n",
    "- average the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In holdout validation, we usually use a 50/50 split instead of the 75/25 split from train/test validation. This way, we remove the number of observations as a potential source of variation in our model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/holdout_validation.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by splitting the data set into 2 nearly equivalent halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "When splitting the data set, don't forget to set a copy of it using .copy() to ensure you don't get any unexpected results later on. If you run the code locally in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab without .copy(), you'll notice what is known as a SettingWithCopy Warning. This won't prevent your code from running properly, but it's letting you know that whatever operation you're doing is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a dataframe. To make sure you don't see this warning, make sure to include .copy() whenever you perform operations on a dataframe.\n",

    "- Select the first 1862 rows and assign to `split_one`.\n",

    "If we average the two RMSE values from the last step, we get an RMSE value of approximately 128.96. Holdout validation is actually a specific example of a larger class of validation techniques called k-fold cross-validation. While holdout validation is better than train/test validation because the model isn't repeatedly biased towards a specific subset of the data, both models that are trained only use half the available data. K-fold cross validation, on the other hand, takes advantage of a larger proportion of the data during training while still rotating through different subsets of the data to avoid the issues of train/test validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the algorithm from k-fold cross validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- splitting the full dataset into `k` equal length partitions.\n",
    "    - selecting `k-1` partitions as the training set and\n",
    "    - selecting the remaining partition as the test set\n",
    "- training the model on the training set.\n",
    "- using the trained model to predict labels on the test fold.\n",
    "- computing the test fold's error metric.\n",
    "- repeating all of the above steps `k-1` times, until each partition has been used as the test set for an iteration.\n",
    "- calculating the mean of the `k` error values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holdout validation is essentially a version of k-fold cross validation when `k` is equal to `2`. Generally, `5` or `10` folds is used for k-fold cross-validation. Here's a diagram describing each iteration of 5-fold cross validation:\n",

    "<img src=\"figs/kfold_cross_validation.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "As you increase the number the folds, the number of observations in each fold decreases and the variance of the fold-by-fold errors increases. Let's start by manually partitioning the data set into 5 folds. Instead of splitting into 5 dataframes, let's add a column that specifies which fold the row belongs to. This way, we can easily select our training set and testing set.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the average RMSE value was approximately 129, the RMSE values ranged from 102 to 164+. This large amount of variability between the RMSE values means that we're either using a poor model or a poor evaluation criteria (or a bit of both!). By implementing your own k-fold cross-validation function, you hopefully acquired a good understanding of the inner workings of the technique. The function we wrote, however, has many limitations. If we want to now change the number of folds we want to use, we need to make the function more general so it can also handle randomizing the ordering of the rows in the dataframe and splitting into folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we're interested in building a good model and accurately understanding how well it will perform. To build a better k-nearest neighbors model, we can change the features it uses or tweak the number of neighbors (a hyperparameter). To accurately understand a model's performance, we can perform k-fold cross validation and select the proper number of folds. We've learned how scikit-learn makes it easy for us to quickly experiment with these different knobs when it comes to building a better model. Let's now dive into how we can use scikit-learn to handle cross-validation as well.\n",
    "\n",

Through lots of trial and error, data scientists have converged on `10` as the standard k value.\n",

For example, assuming that only one feature, like a car's weight, relates to a car's fuel efficiency will lead you to fit a simple, univariate regression model that will result in high bias. The error rate will be high since a car's fuel efficiency is affected by many other factors besides just its weight.\n",

In an ideal world, we want low bias and low variance but in reality, there's always a tradeoff.\n",
