    "At its core, data science helps us make sense of the massive world of information all around us — a world that's far too complex to study directly by ourselves. Data is the record of everything that's going on and what we should learn from it. The real value of all this information is what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning helps us discover patterns in data, which is where meaning lives. When we can see what the data means, we can make predictions about the future.\n",

    "We'll use a dataset of AirBnB rental rates to identify similar rates in one area for competing AirBnB units and make predictions for ideal rates to maximize profit. You'll need to be comfortable programming in Python, and you'll need to be familiar with the NumPy and pandas libraries.\n",

    "- `latitude`: latitude of the geographic coordinates\n",
    "- `longitude`: longitude of the geographic coordinates\n",
    "- `city`: the city of the rental\n",
    "- `zipcode`: the zip code of the rental\n",
    "- `state`: the state the rental\n",
    "- `accommodates`: the number of guests the rental can accommodate\n",
    "- `room_type`: the type of rental (Private room, Shared room or Entire home/apt\n",
    "- `bedrooms`: number of bedrooms included in the rental\n",
    "- `bathrooms`: number of bathrooms included in the rental\n",
    "- `beds`: number of beds included in the rental\n",
    "- `price`: nightly price for the rental\n",
    "- `cleaning_fee`: additional fee for cleaning the rental after the guest leaves\n",
    "- `security_deposit`: refundable security deposit, in case of damages\n",
    "- `minimum_nights`: minimum number of nights a guest can stay at the rental\n",
