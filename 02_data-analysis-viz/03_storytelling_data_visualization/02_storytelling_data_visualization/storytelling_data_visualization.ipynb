    "According to some, what we did is storytelling with data. However, is presenting the top 20 countries according to death toll really a story?\n",

    "In a broad sense, a story is a sequence of events: something happens, then something else happens, and so on. Rather than events, our graph above presents facts.\n",

    "This data story shows the evolution of the death toll in the United States. At the end of March, we see the death toll at 2,398 deaths, but in December, it became 295,406 — it has changed. Following the four line plots, we see a sequence of events that led to that change. For instance, a surge in the average number of daily deaths starting in April resulted in a large number of deaths at the end of June."
