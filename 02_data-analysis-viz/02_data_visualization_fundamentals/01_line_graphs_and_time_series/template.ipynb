    "<p>We can create a graph by drawing two lines at right angles to each other. Each line is called an <strong>axis</strong> — the horizontal line at the bottom is the <strong>x-axis</strong>, and the vertical line on the left is the <strong>y-axis</strong>. The point where the two lines intersect is called the <strong>origin</strong>.</p>\n",
    "<p></p><center><img src=\"figs/m1_2.png\" alt=\"img\"></center><p></p>\n",

    "<p></p><center><img src=\"figs/m1_3.png\" alt=\"img\"></center><p></p>\n",
    "<p>The length of the axes helps us precisely locate any point drawn on the graph. Point <em>A</em> on the graph below, for instance, is seven length units away from the y-axis and two units away from the x-axis.</p>\n",
    "<p></p><center><img src=\"figs/m1_4.png\" alt=\"img\"></center><p></p>\n",
    "<p>The two numbers that represent the distances of a point from the x- and y-axis are called <strong>coordinates</strong>. Point <em>A</em> above has two coordinates: seven and two. Seven is the x-coordinate, and two is the y-coordinate.</p>\n",
    "<p>The coordinates often appear in the form (x, y), with the x-coordinate first. So the coordinates of <em>A</em> are (7, 2). So, here's what we need to know about coordinates:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
